This is the template app for Tealeaf Academy. It's a bare bones Rails 3 app, with
Twitter Bootstrap integrated. There are also layout modifications: a navigation partial
and a message partial to display flash messages.

To get started:
1. bundle install
2. rake db:create
3. rake db:migrate
4. rails server
5. Navigate to localhost:3000
